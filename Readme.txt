How the app works: 
The app contains 5 buttons: 

WALK 
RUN
EAT
DELETE TABLE
RECREATE TABLE
TRAIN
DO NOT CLICK THIS

WALK, RUN, EAT will be used to generate the dataset. Just click on any one of these 3 buttons, and perform the corresponding activity. The accelerometer will be activated for exactly 5 mins. The accelerometer data will be stored in the database with the table name "dairy". 

When the dataset has been built using the WALK, RUN, EAT buttons, click the TRAIN button. You can see the accuracy in console of the Android Studio. The dataset that I have provided gives accuracy of approx 69%.

The buttons DELETE TABLE and RECREATE TABLE will delete the table and make new table respectively.

DO NOT CLICK THIS has no functionality. So, please don't click this.

The Library has been downloaded from github created by a user named yctung. This is the link : https://github.com/yctung/AndroidLibSvm.
Plese make sure you have NDK installed.
